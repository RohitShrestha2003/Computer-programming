Introducing Sets

The Set data type is similar to lists and tuples but has important differences. Sets do not store elements in any specific order and do not allow duplicate values. Each element in a set must be unique. Sets can only contain immutable values, meaning that lists or other mutable objects cannot be stored in them.

Regular sets are mutable, meaning elements can be added and removed after creation. However, because sets are unordered, they do not support indexing or slicing. Instead, they support mathematical-style operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

Sets are highly efficient for membership testing. Checking whether an element exists in a set is significantly faster than performing the same check in a list, especially when dealing with large collections of data. This makes sets ideal for scenarios where uniqueness and fast lookup are required.

Set Comprehensions

Set comprehensions provide a concise way to create sets. They work in the same way as list comprehensions but use curly braces instead of square brackets. A set comprehension evaluates an expression for each item in an iterable and adds the result to the set.

Because sets do not allow duplicates, any repeated values generated by a set comprehension are automatically removed. Set comprehensions can also include conditions to filter which values are included in the final set.

Mutable and Immutable Sets

A standard set is mutable, meaning its contents can be changed after it has been created. Elements can be added or removed, and operations can be applied that modify the set directly.

An immutable set is known as a frozenset. Once a frozenset has been created, its contents cannot be changed. Frozensets support all accessor and comparison operations but do not support any methods that would modify the contents. Frozensets are useful when a fixed collection of unique values is required.

Set Operations

Sets support a number of mathematical operations. These include union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations allow sets to be combined, compared, and filtered in powerful ways.

Union combines elements from two sets. Intersection returns only the elements that appear in both sets. Difference returns elements that are in one set but not in the other. Symmetric difference returns elements that are in either set but not in both.

These operations can be performed using operators or equivalent method calls. Some operations return new sets, while others modify the existing set directly.

Set Comparison Operations

Sets can be compared using subset and superset relationships. A subset contains only elements that exist in another set. A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the original set. A superset contains all elements of another set. A proper superset is a superset that is not equal to the original set.

These comparisons return Boolean values and are useful when checking group relationships.

Introduction to Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection data type that stores data as key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a single value. Keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated. Dictionaries are ordered and mutable, meaning elements are stored in insertion order and can be changed after creation.

Dictionaries are ideal for situations where data needs to be accessed quickly using a known key. They provide very fast lookup times and are commonly used to store records, configurations, and mappings.

Creating Dictionaries

Dictionaries can be created using curly braces with key-value pairs separated by colons. They can also be created using constructor functions. Empty dictionaries can be created easily and populated later.

The keys in a dictionary must be immutable types such as strings, numbers, or tuples. Values can be of any data type.

Dictionary Comprehensions

Dictionary comprehensions allow dictionaries to be created programmatically in a concise way. They are similar to list and set comprehensions but generate key-value pairs. Each iteration produces a key and a value, which are added to the dictionary.

This approach is useful when creating dictionaries from sequences or when transforming data into a mapping structure.

Working with Dictionaries

Dictionary values are accessed using their keys. Keys are used in place of indexes, which distinguishes dictionaries from lists, tuples, and strings. If a key does not exist, an error can occur unless handled safely.

Dictionaries are mutable, so new key-value pairs can be added and existing ones updated. Values can also be removed using specific operations.

Membership testing can be performed on dictionaries to check whether a key exists. This is useful for validating input and preventing errors.

Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries provide many built-in methods for managing their contents. These include methods to remove elements, copy the dictionary, retrieve values safely, and update multiple key-value pairs at once.

Some methods return values, while others modify the dictionary directly. Understanding which methods mutate the dictionary and which simply access data is important for correct program behaviour.

Iterating Over Dictionaries

Dictionaries can be iterated in several ways. Iteration can be done over keys, over values, or over key-value pairs. Iterating over keys is the default behaviour. Iterating over values allows access to stored data. Iterating over key-value pairs provides access to both elements together.

Key-value pairs are often unpacked into separate variables during iteration, making it easy to process each entry.

Key Terminology

Set – An unordered collection of unique values.  
Set Operations – Mathematical operations performed on sets such as union and intersection.  
Set Comprehension – A concise way to generate sets using expressions.  
Dictionary – A collection of key-value pairs.  
Key-Value Pair – A mapping between a unique key and its associated value.
